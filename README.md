# Paczkolab by Jakub Paluszkiewicz and Marta Korza

## Description
We wrote this project in pair. We are using here back-end wrote in PHP and front-end with JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax. This is system where you can add size of pack, add addresses where packs will be send. add users with theirs addresses, names and credits. There is place where you need to add users(customers), select from list address of this customer, add names and some credits. If you made a mistake you can delete or edit user.

When you have that informations, you can send pack to customer by selecting address, customer and pick size. We forget to make a functionalities, that when customer haven't much credits, pack won't be send. But this is a quick thing so I think I will add it soon.
